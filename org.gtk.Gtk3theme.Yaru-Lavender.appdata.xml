  <releases>
        <release version="21.04snap" date="2021-05-02">
            <description>New release! Much exciting! Very wow!

- Recreated everything on the base of Yaru 21.04!
- Added GTK4 support (not Gnome-Shell 40)
- Added two new colors: Aubergine and Lavender
- Rewrite some code
- Added a tutorial for compiling own themes (in ./src)

Please note:
Due the lack of time I wasn't able to make long-term testing and test the themes very well. I checked them and didn't notice any major bugs.
Please excuse me if there are major bugs and report them as issue. I'll try to fix them as soon as possible!

Only known bug:
In Gnome 40 shell are some "glitches" or wrong looking buttons. This is just because Yaru doesn't support the shell of Gnome 40 officially, yet. As soon as they release the support, I'll update Yaru-Colors as well.
